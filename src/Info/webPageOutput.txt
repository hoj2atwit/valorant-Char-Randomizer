Story
Valorant
takes
place
on
a
version
of
Earth
in
the
near
future
following
an
event
known
as
First
Light.
This
event
spans
the
entire
globe,
leading
to
big
transformations
to
life,
technology,
and
how
governments
operate.
However,
select
people
across
the
globe
start
to
gain
abilities
stemming
from
this
massive
event.
These
gifted
individuals
are
called
Radiants.
In
response
to
First
Light,
a
shadow
organization
founds
the
Valorant
Protocol,
which
pulls
together
Agents
from
all
over
the
world.
These
Agents
consist
of
Radiants
and
other
individuals
equipped
with
Radiant
technology.
Due
to
the
backstories
of
these
characters,
the
Valorant
team
features
interesting
dynamics
as
the
individuals
not
only
sometimes
know
each
other,
but
they
also
come
from
a
wide
spectrum
of
backgrounds
ranging
from
crime
to
the
military.

Gameplay
Valorant
is
a
competitive
tactical
shooter
from
the
first-person
perspective.
It
takes
place
on
a
near-future
Earth
and
features
a
cast
of
characters
known
as
Agents,
each
of
which
have
their
own
unique
set
of
abilities
to
create
tactical
opportunities.
Ten
players
are
divided
into
two
teams,
Attackers
and
Defenders,
with
the
goal
of
winning
the
most
rounds.
In
order
to
win
a
round,
a
team
must
eliminate
the
opposing
team
or
complete
their
team-specific
Spike
objective.
First
team
who
reaches
13
rounds,
wins
the
game.
The
game
starts
in
a
lobby,
where
players
have
to
lock
in
their
Agent.
The
lobby
lasts
for
80
seconds
or
until
everyone
has
locked
in
their
Agent.
Only
one
of
each
Agent
can
be
selected
on
each
team
and
players
cannot
see
which
Agent
has
been
picked
on
the
opposing
team
until
the
first
Buy
Phase.
The
Buy
Phase
occurs
before
each
round
and
lasts
for
30
seconds.
During
Buy
Phase,
most
areas
of
the
map
are
inaccessible
and
the
two
teams
cannot
meet
each
other.
Therefore,
Attackers
cannot
enter
sites
and

Development
The
project
was
conceived
in
early
2013
within
a
small
R&amp;D
team
of
designers
at
Riot
Games,
who
were
looking
to
innovate
genres
with
closed
legacy
loops
into
live
service
games.
Tactical
shooters
are
challenging
and
competitive,
with
a
history
over
competitive
integrity.
These
ideas
became
core
to
the
project,
and
the
game
was
developed
alongside
anti-cheat
measures.&#91;1&#93;

"Project
A"
Announcement
Valorant
was
announced
with
the
codename
"Project
A"
on
October
15,
2019
through
Riot
Games'
10th
Anniversary
edition
of
their
"Riot
Pls"
blog,
which
celebrated
10
years
since
the
release
of
their
multiplayer
online
battle
arena
video
game
League
of
Legends.
In
an
announcement
video,
Anna
"SuperCakes"
Donlon,
the
executive
producer,
describes
the
game
as
a
"character-based
tactical
shooter"
which
focuses
on
competitive
aspects
and
includes
precise
gunplay.
She
also
states
that
the
game
takes
place
on
a
"beautiful,
near-future
Earth"
and
features
a
"lethal
cast
of
characters,
each
with
their
own
unique
abilities".
Riot
further
explains
that
the
game
will
stay
true
to
the
high-consequential
gameplay
of
other
competitive
tactical
shooters
with
the
addition
of
unique
character
abilities
that
create
and
open
tactical
opportunities.
Riot
emphasized
their
attention
on
solving
technical
issues
commonly
found
in
other
competitive
shooters,
focusing
on
improving
global
infrastructure
and
netcode
to
create
lower
server
ping
and
fight
against
peeker's
advantage.
An
anti-cheat
system
is
also
at
the
forefront
of
the
game's
development.
The
reception
of
the
announcement
video
were
generally
positive,
many
people
have
drawn
comparisons
of
Project
A
with
other
competitive
shooters
such
as
Valve
Corporation's
Counter-Strike:
Global
Offensive
and
Blizzard
Entertainment's
Overwatch.
Greg
"Ghostwalker"
Street,
Riot
Games'
vice
president
of
IP
and
Entertainment,
responded
to
the
Overwatch
comparisons
on
Twitter,
saying
"While
we
are
honored
by
comparisons
between
Riot's
Project
A
and
Overwatch,
the
two
aren't
really
in
the
same
genre.
Project
A
is
a
tactical
shooter.
Lethality
is
high
and
you
don't
respawn.
Map
control
and
gunplay
are
key.
The
abilities
are
more
about
utility."&#91;2&#93;
